# Kerapose
`Kerapose` aims to be a very easy to use pose estimator based on Keras. This repository is a work in progress. Please check the example in `notebooks/Model Demo.ipynb` to get a feeling how easy it currently is to use (and find soon that there is some work to do on that aspect :)).

# Credits
The implementation is inspired by the one provided by [michalfaber](https://github.com/michalfaber/keras_Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation). However, while the basic ideas remain intact the implementation in this repository is much different.
